# Regulated Asset Scripts
This guide provides details on how to use the scripts under the `./scripts` folder to interact with the Regulated Asset and the Asset Controller contracts.

## Deploy on Futurenet

1. Access the folder `/scripts`. There you'll find a collection of helpers scripts to deploy and test this contract.
2. Set the parameters under `config.sh`. By default, they come set for futurenet with dummy accounts and assets.
3. Run `init.sh all` to deploy and initialize both contracts according to the defined parameters.

For further details on how to configure and use the helper scripts, refer to [./scripts/README](scripts/README.md).

## Usage

One can use the `run.sh` helper script to execute the different contract functions. Here below is a list of the supported interactions with the contracts.
For the full list of commands run the following:

```bash
./run.sh h
